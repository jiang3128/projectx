        <h1>Week 2: What I learned?</h1>
        <h2>HTML Geolocation</h2>
        <p>The HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a user's position but based on it could compromise personal privacy, the position is not available if the user is not aprroving it.</p>
        <p>There are serveral properties that the programmer could get the user's location which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>coords.latitude - The latitude as a decimal number</li>
            <li>coords.longtitude - The longtitude as a decimal number</li>
            <li>coords.accuracy - The accuracy of position</li>
            <li>coords.altitude - The altitude in meters above the mean sea level</li>
            <li>watchPosition() and clearWatch() is used for getting the user's position and continues to return updated position until it reached the clearwatch() to stop tracking the curent address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I always curious about how the phone apps like google maps and uber can track the drivers location, I know it is definately not just pressing the GPS button</p>
        <p>through w3schools I am to be able to understand how the properties works and how to use it when you creating an app when the position is needed. 
            Also, it teaches me how the browser getting your personal information when you might or might not noticed.</p>
        <p><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp">w3schools</a> is where I got the fun aspect of HTML. Go check it out!</p>
        <p>Code samples is below:</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "code">
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
            
            &lt;p&gt;Click the button to get your coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;button onclick="getLocation()"&gt;Try It&lt;/button&gt;
            
            &lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;script&gt;
            var x = document.getElementById("demo");
            
            function getLocation() {
              if (navigator.geolocation) {
                navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition);
              } else { 
                x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
              }
            }
                
            function showPosition(position) {
                x.innerHTML="Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
                "&lt;br&gt;Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
            }
            &lt;/script&gt;

        <h2>CSS: hover</h2>
        <p>The hover selector is used to select elements and changing the base color when you mouse over it.
            It can be used on all elements and not just on links, but it must come after :link and :visited in the 
            CSS definition to be effective.
        </p>
        <p>Time for a trial:</p>
        <p id = "hoverJerry">jerry</p>
        <p id = "hoverTom">tom</p>
        <p>TA mentioned that hover CSS is one of the animation that can be used in our project 1, so browsing it on w3schools
            is a good idea that can be having. I learned how the properties can be used on the website such as our UWEC website
            and w3schools. This is useful to notify the user what they are selecting, and gives more interaction between the user
            and websites.

        <P>The CSS that I'm using on the hover showing:</P>
        <div class ="code">
            #hoverJerry{
                background-color: black;
                color:white;
                padding: 20px;
                text-align: center;
            }
            #hoverJerry:hover{
                background-color: darkgray;
                font-size: larger;
                text-transform: uppercase;

        <h2>CSS Navigation Bars</h2>
        <p>Having a navigation on your website make it easy for the user to find what they are actually wants, with CSS 
            you can make the navigation more attractive to the user.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href>Home</a></li>
            <li><a href>Job</a></li>
            <li><a href>Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> Learning how to use the navigation bar it makes the user could interact with the website.
            Since it ease the user's life it would be a great idea to put the navigation bar into my project 1.
            Most of the webpages are having a different style of navigation bars on side, it can be vertically or horizontally
            depends on the webpage designs.
