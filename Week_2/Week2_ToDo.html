        <h2>HTML Geolocation</h2>
        <p>The HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a user's position but based on it could compromise personal privacy, the position is not available if the user is not aprroving it.</p>
        <p>There are serveral properties that the programmer could get the user's location which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>coords.latitude - The latitude as a decimal number</li>
            <li>coords.longtitude - The longtitude as a decimal number</li>
            <li>coords.accuracy - The accuracy of position</li>
            <li>coords.altitude - The altitude in meters above the mean sea level</li>
            <li>watchPosition() and clearWatch() is used for getting the user's position and continues to return updated position until it reached the clearwatch() to stop tracking the curent address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I always curious about how the phone apps like google maps and uber can track the drivers location, I know it is definately not just pressing the GPS button</p>
        <p>through w3schools I am to be able to understand how the properties works and how to use it when you creating an app when the position is needed. 
            Also, it teaches me how the browser getting your personal information when you might or might not noticed.</p>
        <p><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp">w3schools</a> is where I got the fun aspect of HTML. Go check it out!</p>
        <p>Code samples is below:</p>
        <div class = "code">
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
            
            &lt;p&gt;Click the button to get your coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;button onclick="getLocation()"&gt;Try It&lt;/button&gt;
            
            &lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;script&gt;
            var x = document.getElementById("demo");
            
            function getLocation() {
              if (navigator.geolocation) {
                navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition);
              } else { 
                x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
              }
            }
                
            function showPosition(position) {
                x.innerHTML="Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
                "&lt;br&gt;Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
            }
            &lt;/script&gt;
            
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
